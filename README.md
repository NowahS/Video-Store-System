# Video-Store-System
Project for Data Structures and Algorithms where we were tasked to design a video store management system to help improve the efficency of the business. The system includes multiple interfaces that were designed to impove the organization of all the information necessary to run the business. Such interfaces include: 
- a storage of the store 
- customer system where the user can add new customers and/or pull returning ones information
- Rentals where the user can access and keep track of active rentals from customers.
